# Ruchy Issue: Complex Enum Matching Syntax Error

**Date**: 2025-10-30
**Ruchy Version**: v3.149.0
**Status**: 🔴 **BLOCKING** - RUC-003 RED phase
**Severity**: HIGH - Blocks test development

---

## Problem Summary

When creating property-based tests with multiple enum match expressions, Ruchy compiler throws:
```
Syntax error: Expected RightBrace, found Identifier("println")
```

However, the **exact same patterns work when tested in isolation**. This suggests a compiler bug in handling complex files with multiple similar match expressions.

---

## Reproduction

### File That Fails
- `ruchy/tests/test_microphone.ruchy` (475 LOC)
- Multiple test functions with similar enum matching patterns
- Compiler error occurs somewhere in first 200 lines

### Patterns That Work Individually

✅ **Pattern 1: Match with return in Err arm**
```ruchy
let devices = match detect_devices() {
    Ok(d) => d,
    Err(e) => {
        println!("Error");
        println!("Reason: {:?}", e);
        return;
    }
};
```

✅ **Pattern 2: Nested enum matching**
```ruchy
match result {
    Ok(_) => println!("Success"),
    Err(err) => {
        match err {
            MyError::One(_) => println!("One"),
            _ => println!("Other"),
        }
    }
}
```

✅ **Pattern 3: Multiple sequential matches**
```ruchy
let devices1 = match detect() {
    Ok(d) => d,
    Err(e) => { println!("Error: {:?}", e); return; }
};

let devices2 = match detect() {
    Ok(d) => d,
    Err(e) => { println!("Error: {:?}", e); return; }
};
```

### What Fails

❌ **When combined in a larger file** (~475 LOC with 6 test functions)
- Same patterns fail to compile
- Error message doesn't indicate line number
- Binary search narrows error to lines 80-105, but isolated extraction of those lines works

---

## Investigation Results

### Tests Performed

1. ✅ Individual enum match with return - **WORKS**
2. ✅ Nested enum matching - **WORKS**
3. ✅ Multiple println in Err arm - **WORKS**
4. ✅ Vec<Struct> return type - **WORKS**
5. ✅ Renamed error variables (err1, err2, err3) - **WORKS**
6. ✅ Simple combined file (60 LOC) - **WORKS**
7. ❌ Full test file (475 LOC) - **FAILS**
8. ❌ Partial test file (200 LOC) - **FAILS**

### Narrowing Down

```bash
# Works: First 72 lines
head -72 ruchy/tests/test_microphone.ruchy + main() → ✅

# Works: First 80 lines
head -80 ruchy/tests/test_microphone.ruchy + main() → ✅

# Fails: First 105 lines
head -105 ruchy/tests/test_microphone.ruchy + main() → ❌
```

Error is between lines 80-105, but **extracting those exact lines works in isolation**.

---

## Hypothesis

**Compiler State Issue**: The Ruchy compiler may be accumulating state when processing multiple similar match expressions, causing it to lose track of brace matching in complex files.

**Possible Causes**:
1. Parser state not reset between function definitions
2. Enum matching code generation conflicting when patterns repeat
3. Error recovery in parser causing cascading failures
4. Memory/stack issue in compiler with deeply nested structures

---

## Impact

### Blocked Work
- ✅ RUC-001: Audio speaker configuration - **COMPLETE**
- ✅ RUC-002: CLI interface - **COMPLETE**
- 🔴 **RUC-003**: Microphone configuration - **BLOCKED at RED phase**
  - Cannot create property-based tests
  - Cannot verify test-driven development workflow
  - Cannot proceed with implementation

### Workarounds Attempted
1. ❌ Rename error variables (e → err1, err2, err3)
2. ❌ Simplify match patterns
3. ❌ Remove nested matches
4. ❌ Reduce file size
5. ⚠️  **Pending**: Rewrite with simpler patterns (less comprehensive testing)

---

## Minimal Reproduction Attempt

Created multiple minimal test cases - **all work correctly**:
- `/tmp/test_nested_match.ruchy` - ✅ Works
- `/tmp/test_nested_with_param.ruchy` - ✅ Works
- `/tmp/test_nested_wildcard.ruchy` - ✅ Works
- `/tmp/test_err_print.ruchy` - ✅ Works
- `/tmp/test_multi_print.ruchy` - ✅ Works
- `/tmp/test_return_in_match.ruchy` - ✅ Works
- `/tmp/test_vec_return.ruchy` - ✅ Works
- `/tmp/ruchy_issue_minimal.ruchy` - ✅ Works

**Conclusion**: Bug only manifests in larger files with specific combinations.

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate (Stop the Line)
1. **File upstream issue** at https://github.com/paiml/ruchy/issues
   - Title: "Syntax error in complex files with multiple enum matches"
   - Include: This document, failing file, working minimal cases
   - Expected: Line number in error message, or fix for state issue

2. **Create workaround** for RUC-003:
   - Simplify test structure
   - Split into multiple files
   - Use simpler match patterns (trade-off: less comprehensive testing)

### Short Term
1. Monitor issue for Ruchy maintainer response
2. Test each new Ruchy release for fix
3. Implement RUC-003 with simplified tests

### Long Term
1. Once fixed, enhance test coverage
2. Add regression test for this pattern
3. Document patterns to avoid

---

## Temporary Solution

Created simplified RED phase test that avoids the issue:

```ruchy
// Simplified test approach - less comprehensive but functional
fun test_mic_detection() {
    println!("Testing microphone detection...");

    match detect_microphone_devices() {
        Ok(devices) => {
            println!("Found {} devices", devices.len());
        }
        Err(_) => {
            println!("Expected failure - not implemented");
        }
    }
}
```

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Compiles and runs
- ✅ Verifies RED phase (tests fail as expected)
- ❌ Less comprehensive testing
- ❌ Doesn't verify all properties
- ❌ Weaker error handling coverage

---

## Files Affected

### Blocked
- `ruchy/tests/test_microphone.ruchy` - Cannot compile

### Reference
- `ruchy/tests/test_audio_speakers.ruchy` - Similar pattern, works (RUC-001)
- `ruchy/bin/ubuntu-audio.ruchy` - Uses similar patterns, works (RUC-002)

**Difference**: RUC-003 test file has more test functions (6 vs 3-4 in others).

## Toyota Way Applied

**✅ Stop the Line**: Immediately halted progress when bug discovered
**✅ Go and See**: Created 10+ test cases to understand the issue
**✅ Kaizen**: Documented thoroughly for continuous improvement
**✅ Respect**: Will file actionable issue with reproduction steps
**🔄 Next**: File upstream issue, implement workaround
