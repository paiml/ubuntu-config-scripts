# SEARCH-002: Script Metadata Extraction

**Priority**: P0 (Critical)
**Estimate**: 3 hours
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

## Objective
Extract metadata from all TypeScript scripts including description, usage, dependencies, and tags.

## Technical Requirements
1. ✅ TypeScript file content parsing
2. ✅ JSDoc comment extraction
3. ✅ Import statement analysis
4. ✅ Category inference from file path
5. ✅ Tag generation from content

## Progress
- [x] Ticket document created
- [x] RED: 21 failing tests written
- [x] GREEN: Implementation with 99.2% coverage
- [x] REFACTOR: Not needed (simple implementation)
- [x] QUALITY GATE: All tests pass

## Test Results
- **Unit Tests**: 21 passing
- **Coverage**: 99.2% line, 95.8% branch
- **Time**: ~50ms

## Files Created
- `scripts/lib/script-analyzer.ts` (189 lines)
- `tests/lib/script-analyzer.test.ts` (21 tests)

## Implementation Details
- Regex-based JSDoc parsing (no AST needed)
- Multiple import statement styles supported
- Keyword-based tag generation (28 common terms)
- Path-based category inference (audio/system/dev/other)

## Next Steps
- SEARCH-003: Embedding generation for semantic search
- SEARCH-004: Database seeding with extracted metadata

- f4a08a6: [SEARCH-002] RED: failing tests for script metadata extraction
- 864aa09: [SEARCH-002] GREEN: Script analyzer implementation with 21 passing tests
