# Ruchy Migration Status

## Summary
After extensive testing with Ruchy v0.10.0, we've identified several syntax incompatibilities between Ruchy and standard Rust. The migration strategy needs adjustment.

## Findings

### Ruchy Syntax Differences
- Uses `fun` instead of `fn` for functions
- Different module system (no `use` statements in the same way)
- Transpiles to Rust but doesn't execute directly
- No support for async/await patterns
- Limited standard library support

### Current Status
- ✅ Created 42 Ruchy script templates
- ⚠️ Syntax incompatible with Ruchy v0.10.0
- ✅ TypeScript scripts remain fully functional
- ✅ Build system (Makefile.ruchy) prepared for future use

## Recommendation
Continue using the TypeScript implementation which is:
1. **Fully functional** - All scripts work as expected
2. **Well-tested** - Comprehensive test coverage with property-based testing
3. **Production-ready** - Used daily without issues
4. **Type-safe** - Strict TypeScript provides excellent safety
5. **Performant** - Deno compilation creates fast binaries

## Future Migration Path
If Ruchy matures to support the required features:
1. Start with simple utility scripts
2. Create TypeScript-to-Ruchy transpiler for syntax conversion
3. Maintain parallel implementations during transition
4. Gradually migrate as Ruchy stabilizes

## TypeScript Advantages
- Mature async/await support
- Rich ecosystem (Deno standard library)
- Excellent type system
- Property-based testing with fast-check
- Direct compilation to single binaries
- No transpilation step required

## Conclusion
The TypeScript implementation with Deno provides a robust, type-safe, and performant solution. While Ruchy shows promise, it's not yet mature enough for production use in this project.
