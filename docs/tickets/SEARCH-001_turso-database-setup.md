# SEARCH-001: Turso Database Setup and Schema Design

**Priority**: P0 (Critical)  
**Estimate**: 4 hours  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

## Objective
Set up Turso database connection and design schema for storing script metadata and embeddings.

## Technical Requirements
1. ✅ Turso client setup for Deno
2. ✅ Schema with vector search support  
3. ✅ Connection pooling and error handling
4. ✅ Environment-based configuration
5. ⏳ Migration scripts (deferred to SEARCH-004)

## Progress
- [x] Ticket document created
- [x] RED: Failing tests written (15 tests initially, refined to 23)
- [x] GREEN: Minimal implementation (125 lines)
- [x] REFACTOR: JSDoc documentation added
- [x] QUALITY GATE: 23 tests passing, 11,000+ property test iterations

## Test Results
- **Unit Tests**: 12 passing (constructor validation, state management)
- **Property Tests**: 11 passing (11,000+ iterations total)
- **Coverage**: 23.5% line (low due to DB methods needing integration tests)
- **Branch Coverage**: 85.7%

## Files Created
- `scripts/lib/turso-client.ts` (125 lines)
- `tests/lib/turso-client.test.ts` (12 tests)
- `tests/lib/turso-client.property.test.ts` (11 property tests, 1000+ iterations each)
- `.env.example` (configuration template)

## Notes
- Using @libsql/client v0.5.6 for Deno
- Web client doesn't support `:memory:` databases - integration tests need real Turso DB
- Connection/query/execute methods will be integration-tested in SEARCH-004
- Constructor validation and state management are thoroughly tested (23 tests)
- Property-based tests cover edge cases with 11,000+ iterations

## Next Steps
- SEARCH-002: Script metadata extraction
- SEARCH-004: Database seeding (will include integration tests)

**Commits**:
- d8e0599: [SEARCH-001] RED: failing tests for Turso database client
- 4f82a40: [SEARCH-001] GREEN: Turso client implementation with 23 passing tests
