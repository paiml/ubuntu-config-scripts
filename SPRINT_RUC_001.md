### RUC-001-004: Create testing framework with property-based testing
**Priority**: High  
**Status**: ðŸ”„ Ready  
**Story Points**: 5

- [ ] Test utilities for common patterns (file operations, command execution)
- [ ] Mock system for testing without side effects
- [ ] Test reporting and coverage integration
- [ ] Example tests demonstrating patterns

**Technical Tasks**:
- Research and select property-based testing library for Ruchy
- Create test utility functions for common operations
- Implement mock system for system calls
- Set up test reporting and integration with coverage
- Create example tests for core functionality
- Document testing patterns and conventions

### RUC-001-005: Set up quality gates (80% coverage, no critical issues)
**Priority**: Medium  
**Status**: ðŸ”„ Ready  
**Story Points**: 3  

**Description**: Implement automated quality gates for code quality enforcement

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Automated coverage checking with 80% minimum threshold
- [ ] Linting quality gates with zero critical issues policy
- [ ] Integration with build system to fail on quality violations
- [ ] Quality reporting dashboard or summary
- [ ] Documentation of quality standards and exceptions

**Technical Tasks**:
- Implement coverage threshold checking
- Set up linting quality gates
- Create quality reporting system
- Integrate quality checks with build system
- Document quality standards and enforcement policies
