# RUC-023: CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions

**Date**: 2025-10-31
**Status**: üü¢ **READY** - All code complete, ready for automation
**Priority**: HIGH (quality assurance and professional standards)
**Methodology**: Extreme TDD (Define ‚Üí Implement ‚Üí Validate)
**Depends On**: RUC-020 ‚úÖ (integration tests), RUC-021 ‚úÖ (install.sh)
**Estimated Time**: 60-90 minutes

---

## Objective

Implement automated testing and quality gates using GitHub Actions to ensure continuous quality assurance for all changes. Automatically run integration tests, validate installation, and enforce quality standards on every commit and pull request.

**Goal**: Professional CI/CD pipeline that catches regressions and validates quality automatically.

---

## Why CI/CD Now?

### 1. Quality Assurance ‚úÖ
- 18 modules complete and tested
- Integration test suite ready (476 LOC, 8 scenarios)
- Need to prevent regressions
- Automate what we've been testing manually

### 2. Professional Standards üéØ
- v1.0.0 release ready
- Expecting users and potential contributors
- Automated quality gates are industry standard
- Builds confidence in project quality

### 3. Enables Future Work üöÄ
- When Issues #90/#103 fixed, CI catches problems
- Validates installation across environments
- Tests new contributions automatically
- Prepares for collaboration

### 4. No Blockers ‚ú®
- Doesn't require upstream fixes
- Tests existing interpreter mode
- Uses current integration tests
- Validates current functionality

## GREEN Phase: Implementation Plan

### Task 1: Create GitHub Actions Workflow (30 minutes)

**RED - Requirements**:
- Workflow triggers on push and PR
- Installs Ruchy v3.153.0+
- Runs integration tests
- Validates installation

**GREEN - Implementation**:

Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, master ]

jobs:
  test:
    name: Integration Tests
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-20.04, ubuntu-22.04, ubuntu-24.04]
        ruchy-version: ['3.153.0', '3.154.0']

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Rust
        uses: actions-rust-lang/setup-rust-toolchain@v1
        with:
          toolchain: stable

      - name: Cache Ruchy installation
        uses: actions/cache@v3
        with:
          path: ~/.cargo/bin/ruchy
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-ruchy-${{ matrix.ruchy-version }}

      - name: Install Ruchy
        run: |
          if ! command -v ruchy &> /dev/null; then
            cargo install ruchy --version ${{ matrix.ruchy-version }}
          fi
          ruchy --version

      - name: Run integration tests
        run: |
          cd ruchy

          echo "Running integration test scenario 1: System Health Check"
          ruchy tests/integration/test_system_health.ruchy

          echo "Running integration test scenario 2: Utility Chain"
          ruchy tests/integration/test_utility_chain.ruchy

      - name: Test installation
        run: |
          ./install.sh

          # Verify ubuntu-diag works
          ubuntu-diag

          echo "Installation test passed!"

      - name: Test uninstallation
        run: |
          ./uninstall.sh <<< "y"

          # Verify clean removal
          if command -v ubuntu-diag &> /dev/null; then
            echo "ERROR: ubuntu-diag still exists after uninstall"
            exit 1
          fi

          echo "Uninstallation test passed!"
```

**REFACTOR**: Optimize caching, add more test scenarios

### Task 2: Add Status Badge (10 minutes)

**RED - Requirements**:
- Badge shows CI status
- Updates automatically
- Links to workflow runs

**GREEN - Implementation**:

Update `README.md`:
```markdown
# Ubuntu Config Scripts

[![CI](https://github.com/username/ubuntu-config-scripts/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/username/ubuntu-config-scripts/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Professional system configuration and diagnostic tools for Ubuntu, written in Ruchy.
```

**REFACTOR**: Add additional badges (version, license, etc.)

### Task 3: Branch Protection Rules (10 minutes)

**RED - Requirements**:
- Status checks must pass before merge
- PRs required for main branch
- At least one review (if team project)

**GREEN - Implementation**:

**GitHub Repository Settings ‚Üí Branches ‚Üí Add Rule**:
```
Branch name pattern: main
‚úì Require status checks to pass before merging
  ‚úì Require branches to be up to date before merging
  Status checks: CI / Integration Tests
‚úì Require pull request reviews before merging (optional)
```

**REFACTOR**: Adjust rules based on team size

### Task 4: Add CI Documentation (15 minutes)

**RED - Requirements**:
- Document CI setup
- Explain how to run tests locally
- Troubleshooting guide

**GREEN - Implementation**:

Create `.github/CONTRIBUTING.md`:
```markdown
# Contributing to Ruchy Ubuntu Config Scripts

## Development Workflow

3. Uninstallation verification

Tests must pass before merge.

### Troubleshooting CI Failures

**"Ruchy not found"**
- CI installs Ruchy automatically
- Check Ruchy version in matrix

**"Integration test failed"**
- Run test locally to reproduce

**GREEN - Implementation**:

```bash
# Create test commit
echo "# CI Testing" >> .github/CI-TEST.md
git add .github/CI-TEST.md
git commit -m "test: Verify CI workflow"
git push

# Watch GitHub Actions
# Verify all jobs pass
# Check badge updates
```

**REFACTOR**: Fix any issues discovered, optimize workflow

- **Confidence**: Know changes work before merge
- **Documentation**: CI setup self-documenting

### Professional Standards üéØ

- **Industry Practice**: CI/CD is standard
- **User Confidence**: Green badge = quality
- **Maintainability**: Automated quality gates
- **Scalability**: Prepares for growth

---

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk ‚úÖ

**Well-Tested Code**:
- 18 modules complete
- Integration tests passing
- Install.sh working

**Standard Practice**:
- GitHub Actions widely used
- Matrix builds common
- Low complexity workflow

### Minimal Risk

**CI Resource Usage**:
- GitHub Actions free tier sufficient
- Minutes used per run: ~10-15
- Mitigation: Optimize caching

**False Positives**:
- Rare with integration tests
- Mitigation: Test locally first
- Mitigation: Clear error messages

---

## Dependencies

- ‚úÖ Install.sh working (RUC-021)
- ‚úÖ Modules functional (RUC-001-019)
- ‚úÖ GitHub repository exists
- ‚úÖ No blockers

---

## Post-Implementation

### Monitoring
- Watch CI runs for patterns
- Track failure rates
- Optimize as needed

### Maintenance

- Add new tests as modules added
- Keep workflow dependencies updated

### Enhancement
- Add more test scenarios
- Implement scheduled runs
- Consider additional quality gates

---

## Alternative Approaches

### Option A: Minimal CI (Faster)
- Only test on Ubuntu 22.04
- Skip multi-environment matrix
- **Time**: 30 minutes
- **Trade-off**: Less coverage

### Option B: Comprehensive CI (Slower)
- Add coverage reporting
- Performance benchmarking
- Security scanning
- **Time**: 120+ minutes
- **Trade-off**: More complex

### Option C: Recommended (Balanced)
- Multi-environment testing
- Integration + installation
- Status badges
- **Time**: 60-90 minutes
- **Trade-off**: Good balance
